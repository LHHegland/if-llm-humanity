## Namespace, Tag, Alias, and Reference Rules

- This is a simplified framework for reasoning and prompting relating to Humanity.
- When relevant, cite concepts as: File → ID → Heading path. For example, when discussing meal planning, cite [[HUMANITY:IADLS]] (ID: HUMANITY.ELEMENTS.ACTIVITIES.IADLS) under Humanity → Elements → Activities → IADLS
- When referencing an entry, prefer canonical tags like [[HUMANITY:IADLS]] over aliases like [[IADLS]] when precision matters.
- Tag Policy
  - Canonical tag format: [[HUMANITY:<LEAF>]] where <LEAF> matches the ID leaf (…ADLS → [[HUMANITY:ADLS]]).
  - Alias tags: uppercase, no namespace (e.g., [[ADLS]] [[ADL]])
  - No alias unless it's truly synonymous.
- If a referenced concept isn't found, be explicit about what you did and didn't find; state clearly:
  - "I didn't find *X* as a named concept in the Index or headings of the file."
  - "Closest match in-file is *Y* (with the tag/ID)."
  - Then proceed using *Y*.
- First check `## Index` for the closest topic handle.
- If the exact concept isn't present, map it to the nearest defined parent concept (Resources/Activities/Needs/ADLs/IADLs).
- Say explicitly when something is not found in the file, then continue with general knowledge labeled as such.
- If the concept will likely recur, suggest an ID + canonical tag + alias tag addition consistent with the file.

##### Wisdom

ID: HUMANITY.ELEMENTS.VALUES.WISDOM
TAGS: [[HUMANITY:WISDOM]]

Consistently gathering, testing, and refining evidence of humanity’s most significant [[HUMANITY:LESSONS]] plus sharing those lessons (i.e. offering testimonials) across our many diverse communities and societies. Basically, these lessons indicate that consistently practicing [[HUMANITY:INTERDEPENDENCE]] often increases the likelihood of more efficiently nurturing and sustaining [[HUMANITY:RESOURCES]], more efficiently performing [[HUMANITY:ACTIVITIES]], and subsequently more efficiently satisfying [[HUMANITY:NEEDS]], collectively, on average, over time. Wisdom is the ability to apply our [[HUMANITY:RESOURCES]] to perform [[HUMANITY:ACTIVITIES]] to satisfy [[HUMANITY:NEEDS]] in a thoughtful and ethical manner. It involves making sound judgments, considering long-term consequences, and acting in ways that benefit both individuals and society, in the present place and time plus elsewhere and throughout the future. Ultimately, it means striving to consistently perform our [[HUMANITY:MISSION]] and contribute to our [[HUMANITY:VISION]].

  - more frequently and consistently practicing compassion often improves relationships and reduces conflict;
  - more frequently and consistently practicing persistence often helps finish hard things;
  - more frequently and consistently practicing interdependence often creates bigger, stronger, and more impactful safety nets;
  - more frequently and consistently practicing wisdom often prevents avoidable messes.
- **Social Reinforcement**: People are more likely to be more frequently, more consistently, and more significantly socially rewarded with support satisfying their [[HUMANITY:NEEDS]] (i.e., or, at least, less likely to experience more frequent, more consistent, and more significant social harms and risks to their ability to satisfy their [[HUMANITY:NEEDS]]) within their affiliated institutions (e.g., families, peer groups, spiritual communities, schools, workplaces), which reinforce these values as follows:
  - praising them;
  - telling illustrative stories about them;
  - building rituals around them;
  - sanctioning choices and actions that do not consistently demonstrate them (e.g., selfishness, rashness, quitting)
